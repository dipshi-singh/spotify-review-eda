# Spotify Reviews EDA

## Overview
This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Spotify reviews to gain insights into user activity, review dynamics, and app version performance. The analysis includes statistical evaluations and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user behavior, review content, and sentiment.

## Sections

### User Activity

#### Number of Reviews per User
- Analyzed the number of reviews written by each user (`userName`).
- **Bar Chart**: Visualizes the number of reviews per user to identify particularly active reviewers.
- **Filtering**: Focused on more engaged users by excluding those with very few reviews.
- **User Segmentation**: Explored potential segments based on review content or behavior.

#### User Behavior
- Examined user behavior patterns at specific times to understand activity trends.

### Review Length

#### Distribution of Review Lengths
- Analyzed the distribution of review lengths (number of characters or words).
- **Histogram**: Plotted to show whether reviews are generally short, long, or evenly distributed.

#### Correlation with Review Score
- Explored the relationship between review length and review score.
- **Scatter Plot**: Used to determine if longer reviews are associated with more positive or negative scores.

### Review Dynamics

#### Average Review Score Over Time
- Tracked changes in average review score over time based on `reviewDate`.
- **Time Series Plot**: Identified trends, potential app updates, or seasonal variations.
- **Line Chart with Seasonality Highlighting**: Emphasized seasonal patterns with shading or annotations.

#### Distribution of Likes and Scores
- Compared the distribution of likes and scores.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Showed if high-rated reviews also tend to receive more likes.

### Content Analysis

#### Word Frequency
- Identified the most frequent words or phrases used in reviews.
- **Word Cloud**: Visualized frequent words to reveal prominent themes or areas of focus.

#### Recurring Themes
- Conducted topic modeling to uncover recurring themes in the reviews.
- **Heatmap/Network Graph**: Visualized relationships between identified topics.

#### Sentiment Analysis
- Applied sentiment analysis to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Used a bar chart or pie chart to show proportions of each sentiment category.

### Understanding App Versions

#### Version Comparison
- Compared average review scores across different app versions.
- **Bar Chart**: Highlighted differences in average scores for various versions.
- **Error Bars**: Included to show variability (standard deviation or confidence interval) around average scores.

#### Correlation with Review Content
- Investigated correlations between app version and review content, such as bug reports.
- **Heatmap/Scatter Plot Matrix**: Used to visualize correlations between app version and review metrics.

## Additional Considerations

### Missing Values
- Identified any missing values in the dataset and assessed their prevalence.
- Explored methods for handling missing values, such as imputation or removal.

### Data Quality
- Checked for outliers or inconsistencies in the data.
- Suggested improvements for data quality to enhance future analyses.
